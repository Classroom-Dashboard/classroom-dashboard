# Classroom Dashboard

Classroom Dashboard is a tool to facilitate student engagement during class and lecture. A student and a professor use the tool in different ways to foster participation, familiarity between student-professor relationships, and help build student-student relationships as well. 

This tool takes advantage of the technology that is often brought into lectures: smart phones and laptops. The functionality includes features such as equity cards to promote student participation and quizzes to promote engagement and attendance. Classroom Dashboard bridges the gap between the surrounding abundance of technology and the manner in which the course material is absorbed by organizing these interactions.
